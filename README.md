# Visual Studio Code Discussions

Ever want somewhere that you can connect with other VS Code users? Where you can ask questions, share ideas, and help out others? Then you've come to the right place!

This project's sole purpose is to implement GitHub Discussions for VS Code, moderated by the VS Code PM and Advocacy teams. The goal of Discussions is to have a searchable forum where people can communicate with the VS Code community, ask and answer questions, share updates, and more. Navigate to the [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions) section of this repo to check it out!

> Looking to contribute to VS Code or to file an issue? Please visit the official [VS Code repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)!

## Participating

Anyone is welcome to open a new discussion topic or to reply to current ones! We want this to be a thriving place of discussion, and we need your participation to do so.

Like every other Microsoft project, we have adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/), which amounts to this: **please be kind in this community and remember that there are real people on the other side of the keyboard.**
For more information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or
contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any questions or comments. 

In addition to the code of conduct, keep these general guidelines in mind when participating:

- GitHub Discussions use categories to help organize discussion topics. As we begin to build this community, we ask that you limit conversations to the categories available (more categories will be released as the community grows!) 

- Before opening a new discussion, please search existing posts to see if the topic thread already exists.

- Please do not use this as a place to @ your favorite engineer to get an extra bump on a feature request. Spoiler: it won't work.

Happy discussing! :)
